This project aims to create a clone of the Google home page.
The clone is entirely visual and would implement none of the actual functionality of the Google home page.
Objective is to learn by experience.

First project of The Odin Project.


Thoughts:

> a lot of messy/unorganised styles.
> would have liked to correct some window resizing issues.
> ui is still the most tedious part of a project for me.
